/**
 * A fixed size map capable of holding up to 32 key-value pairs.

 * A map is an object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate
 * keys; each key can map to at most one value. This interface does not allow
 * keys or values to be {@code null}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Small, fixed sized maps can be implemented using arrays. Such implementations
 * can have similar (or superior) runtime speeds compared to more complicated
 * implementations based on hash tables or search trees.

 * @param <K> the type of keys maintained by this map
